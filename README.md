# Future Updates
This project is a work-in-progess and passion project I want to keep updating to see how far I can go. As of now, I am in the process of adding a fully functional user sign-in system and plan to expand the applications capabilites as I move forward. Furthermore, it is to be expected that I will work on small updates, such as enchancing the user interface, and optimizing my code to be as efficent as possible. For now I made a simple roadmap of what features I plan to add down the road.
