# Description
Efit is a ecommerce solution that is built specifically to sell clothes. It is built and designed with vanilla HTML, CSS and utilizes MySQL, JavaScript and PHP to handle all of the backend. The payment is processed by a secure integrated payment gateway courtesy of the Paypal API. As of now it can be considered a complete project but it is still in its simplest form. You can select items and pay for them. Still this is only the begining and plans to grow this project have been set in stone.

# Future Updates
This project is a work-in-progess and passion project I want to keep updating to see how far I can go. As of now, I am in the process of adding a fully functional user sign-in system and plan to expand the applications capabilites as I move forward. I will also work on small updates, such as enchancing the user interface, and optimizing my code to be as efficent as possible. For now I made a simple roadmap of what features I plan to add down the road and features that have already been implemented.
