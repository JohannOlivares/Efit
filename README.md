# Efit
Efit is a ecommerce website that I have created with the sole purpose of learning to create Ecommerce web applications. It is built and designed with vanilla HTML, CSS and utilizes a MySQL relational database for creating orders, and adding products and it even has a integrated paypal gateway. As of now it is still a work-in-progress and is something that I work on when I have the time. By no means is this an elite level website but I will continue to update this until it gets there.
